Quickstart
++++++++++


You don't need to read all the API documentation if you are really impatien in
getting this tool going. Take a look to the UI_.

Here is how you can use this tool.

How to Launch
=============

Inside Maya you can open a Python shell and copy the following code.

.. note:: Don't forget to add the tool module path to your Python paths.

.. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        import maya_module_controller
        modules_controller = maya_module_controller.run(0)

.. warning:: Due to some Maya 2017 PySide2 weirdness you need too put the \
  maya_module_controller inside a variable in order to have the Qt signals \
  working. This will also allow you to edit the tool behavior with its API.
